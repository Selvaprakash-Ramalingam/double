---

You are now working on task management and planning. Load and reference the following context:

**Active Tasks:** `~/memory/tasks/active.md`
**Backlog:** `~/memory/tasks/backlog.md`
**Waiting On:** `~/memory/tasks/waiting.md`

When discussing tasks:
- Help prioritize and organize work
- Suggest moving tasks between files as status changes
- Cross-reference with project files when relevant
- Update task files as work progresses

Read the contents of these files now to understand current task status.
